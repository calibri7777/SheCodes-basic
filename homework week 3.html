        <strong> History</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Quartz crystal was once believed to be an eternal ice sent by the
        heavenly gods. Until the late 1500s, many scholars thought this stone
        was fossilized ice. People in the earliest recorded times believed in
        the magical powers of quartz. Ancient Roman, Egyptian and Greek
        civilizations used quartz crystals as potent talismans. The word quartz
        is thought to come from the German word "quarz," and the word crystal
        comes from the Greek word "krystallos," which means ice. The Ancient
        Japanese believed quartz formed from the breath of a white dragon, and
        regarded it as representing perfection. Quartz has been used throughout
        history in rain rituals, crystal skulls and spheres for crystal balls to
        predict the future since the middle ages.

        <br />
        Quartz is a hard, crystalline mineral composed of silicon dioxide. The
        atoms are linked in a continuous framework of SiO4 silicon-oxygen
        tetrahedra giving an overall chemical formula of SiO2. Quartz is the
        second most abundant mineral, behind feldspar. Quartz exists in two
        forms, the normal Î±-quartz and the high-temperature Î²-quartz. The
        transformation from Î±-quartz to Î²-quartz takes place abruptly at 573 Â°C.
        Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in
        volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing
        through this temperature threshold. Since antiquity, varieties of quartz
        have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of jewelry and
        hardstone carvings, especially in Eurasia. Quartz is the mineral
        defining the value of 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, a qualitative
        scratch method for determining the hardness of a material to abrasion.

        <br />
        Quartz crystal is a power stone that's prized as a healing stone. It is
        known as the most powerful healing stone of the mineral kingdom, able to
        work on any condition. It has been called the "Universal Crystal"
        because of its many uses and is beneficial for manifesting, healing,
        meditation, protection and channeling. Due to its ability to balance,
        quartz is excellent for harmonizing and stabilizing one's environment
        and is helpful in romantic relationships. It is said to amplify healing
        energy and is particularly effective for chronic fatigue, arthritis,
        bone injuries, depression, diabetes and intestinal troubles. Quartz
        enhances spiritual growth, spirituality and wisdom. Because it clarifies
        thought processes and emotions, it can increase inspiration and
        creativity. It can also help with concentration, studying and retaining
        what one learns.
